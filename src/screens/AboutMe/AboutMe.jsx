          Iâ€™m a passionate freelance motion designer specializing in creating
          dynamic, interactive animations using GSAP. With a solid foundation in
          full-stack development, I build responsive, user-friendly websites and
          applications using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and
          MongoDB. I combine creativity with technical expertise to bring
          engaging web experiences to life, whether it's through seamless
          animations or full-stack solutions. Looking to collaborate on exciting
          projects that push the boundaries of design and functionality.
